# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PocketLedger is a Ruby on Rails 8.0 application using:
- Ruby 3.4.4
- SQLite database with Solid Cache, Solid Queue, and Solid Cable
- Hotwire (Turbo Rails + Stimulus) for frontend interactions
- Kamal for Docker deployment
- Standard Rails MVC architecture

## Development Commands

### Server and Development
- `bin/dev` - Start Rails development server
- `bin/rails server` - Alternative server start command
- `bin/rails console` - Rails console
- `bin/rails dbconsole` - Database console

### Testing and Quality
- `bin/rails test` - Run full test suite (uses parallel testing)
- `bin/rails test test/path/to/specific_test.rb` - Run specific test file
- `bin/rails test:system` - Run system tests only
- `bin/brakeman` - Security vulnerability scanning
- `bin/rubocop` - Code style linting (Rails Omakase rules)

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**IMPORTANT**: This project follows strict Test-Driven Development practices.

#### TDD Process (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first
   - Write unit tests for models/controllers
   - Write system tests for user-facing features
   - Run tests and confirm they fail: `bin/rails test`

2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
   - Implement the feature
   - Run tests until all pass: `bin/rails test`

3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality
   - Clean up implementation
   - Run linter: `bin/rubocop`
   - Ensure tests still pass

#### Testing Guidelines
- **Always write tests before implementation**
- **Unit tests** for models, controllers, helpers
- **System tests** for end-to-end user flows (login, navigation, forms)
- **Run full test suite** before committing: `bin/rails test && bin/rubocop`
- **All tests must pass** before creating pull requests
- Target: Maintain high test coverage for all features

### Git Workflow
**IMPORTANT**: Always create a feature branch for each issue. Never commit directly to `main`.

#### Branch Naming Convention
- Format: `feature/[issue-number]-[short-description]`
- Examples:
  - `feature/21-authenticated-user-routing`
  - `feature/24-rate-limiting-security`
  - `feature/25-data-export-csv-pdf`

#### Development Process for Each Issue
1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[issue-number]-[description]
   ```

2. **Develop Using TDD** (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
   - Write failing tests first
   - Implement feature to make tests pass
   - Refactor and clean up code
   - Run full test suite: `bin/rails test && bin/rubocop`

3. **Commit Changes**
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Reference issue number in commit message
   - Include test results and acceptance criteria
   - Always add Claude Code attribution:

4. **Push and Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/[issue-number]-[description]
   gh pr create --title "feat: [Feature description] (#[issue-number])" --body "[PR description]"
   ```

5. **Merge Pull Request**
   ```bash
   gh pr merge [pr-number] --squash --delete-branch
   ```

6. **Update Main Branch Locally**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

7. **Close Issue**
   ```bash
   gh issue close [issue-number] --comment "[Completion message]"
   ```

### Database
- `bin/rails db:migrate` - Run migrations
- `bin/rails db:create` - Create database
- `bin/rails db:seed` - Seed database

### Deployment
- `bin/kamal deploy` - Deploy via Kamal
- `bin/kamal console` - Remote Rails console
- `bin/kamal shell` - Remote shell access
- `bin/kamal logs` - View application logs

## Architecture

### Core Structure
- **Application Module**: `PocketLedger::Application` (config/application.rb:9)
- **Database**: SQLite with Solid adapters for caching, queuing, and cable
- **Frontend**: Uses Importmap for JS modules, Stimulus controllers in app/javascript/controllers/
- **Styling**: CSS in app/assets/stylesheets/application.css

### Key Rails Configuration
- Rails 8.0 with default configurations loaded
- Autoloads lib/ directory (excluding assets and tasks)
- Uses Solid Queue in Puma process for background jobs (`SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA: true`)
- Test parallelization enabled using number of processors

### Testing Setup
- Minitest framework with parallel test execution
- System tests use Capybara with Selenium WebDriver
- Test helpers in test/test_helper.rb with fixtures support

### Deployment
- Dockerized application using Kamal
- Configured for single-server deployment with SSL via Let's Encrypt
- Persistent storage volume for SQLite and Active Storage files
