# Contributing to PocketLedger

## Development Workflow

### 1. Pick an Issue
- Browse [open issues](https://github.com/heyjosephme/PocketLedger/issues)
- Look for issues tagged with `priority: high` for immediate impact
- Comment on the issue to claim it

### 2. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/issue-number-brief-description
# Example: git checkout -b feature/11-receipt-attachments
```

### 3. Development (TDD Approach)

We follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for production-quality code:

#### TDD Workflow (Red-Green-Refactor)

1. **Write the test first (RED)**
   ```bash
   # Create or update test file
   # Example: test/models/attachment_test.rb

   # Run the test - it should fail
   bin/rails test test/models/attachment_test.rb
   ```

2. **Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)**
   ```bash
   # Implement just enough code to make the test pass
   # Example: app/models/attachment.rb

   # Run the test - it should pass
   bin/rails test test/models/attachment_test.rb
   ```

3. **Refactor (REFACTOR)**
   ```bash
   # Clean up code while keeping tests green
   # Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   bin/rails test

   # Check code style
   bin/rubocop
   ```

4. **Repeat for next feature**

#### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests BEFORE implementation
- Test models: validations, associations, business logic
- Test controllers: authentication, authorization, CRUD operations
- Test system/integration: critical user flows
- Keep tests fast and focused
- Use descriptive test names

#### Pre-Commit Checklist

```bash
# 1. All tests pass
bin/rails test

# 2. No linting issues
bin/rubocop

# 3. No security issues
bin/brakeman

# 4. Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
```

- Make small, focused commits
- Follow Rails conventions and style guide
- Write tests BEFORE features (TDD)
- Run full test suite before committing

### 4. Commit Messages
Follow the conventional commit format:
```
type: brief description

Longer explanation if needed

git push -u origin feature/issue-number-brief-description

# Create PR using gh CLI
gh pr create --title "feat: brief description" --body "Closes #issue-number

## Summary

### 7. Merge
- Squash and merge when approved
- Delete feature branch after merge

## Branch Protection (Manual Setup)

To protect the `main` branch, configure these settings in GitHub:

1. Go to Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - âœ… Require pull request before merging
   - âœ… Require approvals: 1 (if working with others)
   - âœ… Require status checks to pass (when CI is set up)
   - âœ… Do not allow bypassing the above settings

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bin/rails test

# Run specific test file
bin/rails test test/models/expense_test.rb

# Run with coverage
COVERAGE=true bin/rails test
```

## Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
bin/rubocop

# Auto-fix issues
bin/rubocop -A

# Security scan
bin/brakeman
```

## Local Development

```bash
# Start server
bin/dev

# Console
bin/rails console

# Database
bin/rails db:migrate
bin/rails db:seed
```
