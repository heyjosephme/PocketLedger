## Branch Protection (Manual Setup)

To protect the `main` branch, configure these settings in GitHub:

1. Go to Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - âœ… Require pull request before merging
   - âœ… Require approvals: 1 (if working with others)
   - âœ… Require status checks to pass (when CI is set up)
   - âœ… Do not allow bypassing the above settings

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bin/rails test

# Run specific test file
bin/rails test test/models/expense_test.rb

# Run with coverage
COVERAGE=true bin/rails test
```

## Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
bin/rubocop

# Auto-fix issues
bin/rubocop -A

# Security scan
bin/brakeman
```

## Local Development

```bash
# Start server
bin/dev

# Console
bin/rails console

# Database
